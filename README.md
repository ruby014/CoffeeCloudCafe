# ☕ Coffee Cloud Cafe

**Coffee Cloud Cafe** is a full-stack web application built as a passion project to explore the full development cycle of a CRUD-based platform. Designed to simulate an online coffee shop, the app lets users browse trendy drink offerings and manage the product list by adding, updating, or deleting items. This is my very first full-stack application — inspired by my love of cozy drinks.
