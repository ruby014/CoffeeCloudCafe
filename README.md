# Coffee Cloud Cafe
## About the Project
I wanted to learn more about the process of creating a full-stack app, so this project was created within the context of an online coffee store where the user can perform CRUD actions. This is my very first full stack application! I love visiting cafes and sipping on cozy drinks so this application is designed to not only list the trendy drinks offered at an online coffee shop but also allows the user to update, delete, and add more drink products as needed.

## Tech Stack
- MongoDB: For managing product data.
- Express: Backend framework for API creation
- React (Chakra UI): For building the user interface with customizable and accessible components.
- Node.js: For server-side operations.
