# Coffee Cloud Cafe
## About the Project 
I wanted to learn more about the process of creating a full stack app, so this project was created within the context of an online coffee store where the user can perform CRUD actions. This application is designed to not only list the trendy drinks offered at an online coffee shop, but also allows the user to update, delete and add more drink products as needed. 

## Tech Stack 
MongoDB, Express, React (Chakra UI), Node.js
